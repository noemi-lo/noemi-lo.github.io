					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p>Spotify<img src="assets/imgs/NL - WebDev - HW2 (1).pdf" /></p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>

						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p>The goal of the website is to assign users a customized main screen according to what they listen to while communicating different actions pertaining to music and playlist creation. The main website includes three main areas; a personalized home screen (includes recommended playlists and podcasts), a side panel (allows users to return to the home page, search music, create playlsits, and view what they are currently listening to), and a control center at the bottom (used for pausing/playing music, toggling its volume and audio source, and pulling up lyrics/what is next in the queue).</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p>When using this site, the main issue I have is the lack of style consistency. I like the general spacing but a majority of the home screen contents have curved corners. However, the divide between the home page, the control center, and side panel are much more rigid. To create consistency, I curved the edges of these main sections and some of its contents</p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
