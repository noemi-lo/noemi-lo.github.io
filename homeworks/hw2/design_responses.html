							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> When using different sizes of white space, make them multiples of a single number to keep everything consistent and easy on the eyes. Uneven spacing can make a site look awkward and diffcult to read. However, having consistent spacing throughout a given space can showcase different categories of content in a limited area easy to understand. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The examples of different spacing styles and how a website on a desktop differs from on a mobile device. It seems obvious that there is less space available on mobile but I never considered the challenge it creates for developers. However, the article continues to show how modern developers use widely known strategies to make their content digestible for their users.</p>
