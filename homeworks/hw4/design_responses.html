						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned that there are laws in place that set a standard for creating accessible tools for all users. There are widely used rules in place that developers can follow that meet and excede these standards to keep their content accessible to all their users. Withiout these laws and standards, developers would likely overlook basic needs of people with moderate to severe visual impairments which is, like the quate later down says, is just rude.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I really liked how the author added examples of what to do and not to. It helps me understand how to format my own content so that it is easily accessible to all my users. Addiitonally, I liked the point of adding text and symbols to color-centered alerts so that those reliant on these features are able to understand these alerts just as easily as anyone else.</p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>

						</li>
