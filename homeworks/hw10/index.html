					<!-- <p class="caption">Hint: Where should this go in our HTML file? Check this week's lecture slides if you're not sure </p> -->

					There is a "script" folder that contains a script file, called "script.js". Link this JS file in

				</p>
				<div class="code">
					<div class="code-content">
						<div>&lt;script src=&quot;assets/script/script.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<!-- <p class="caption">Hint to start off: how do we start off our JavaScript file? It might be helpful to reference the programming slides this week to see examples of jQuery syntax.</p> -->
				<p> The script file starts with how to make the first outfit appear on Drake when you click on it. The
					other outfits follow the same process.</p>
				<p> <b>Outfit one: </b> We're going to "hide" and "show" the body and outfits to make it seem like we're
					putting the selected outfit on Drake. Get the <code>#s1</code> element. When we click on the
					<code>#s1</code> element, we should hide the <code>#body</code> element (Hint: set the
					<code>#body</code>'s display property to none).</p>
				<p>Next, we're going to hide all the outfits. Let's get the list of <code>.outfit</code> elements (Hint:
					look into <code>getElementsByClassName</code>). Use a <code>for</code> loop to index through every
					outfit in this list, and hide each outfit (Hint: we have to repeat this code for every outfit... how
					can we shorten our code... let's make a function!).</p>
				<p>Finally, to make it seem like Drake has changed into the outfit we selected, let's show the
					<code>#o1</code> element (Hint: set the <code>o1</code>'s display property to block).</p>
				<p class="caption">Hint: Check Week 9 slides to refresh on how to get elements and Week 11 slides for
					the for loop syntax.</p>
				<p> Repeat this process for the other outfits and replace <code>s1</code> and <code>o1</code> with the
					respective outfit numbers.</p>
				<!-- <p>There are <b>two</b> ways to implement the same functionality. One solution is shorter and more elegant than the other, but you can implement Dress Drizzy in whatever way makes sense to you.</p>
						<p>The <b>first</b> solution is to show the corresponding outfit for every outfit selection. Pay attention to the ids in the HTML. For example, if the user were to click on element "#s1", we would want to show "#o1". Repeat the same steps for "#s2" through "#s5" and "#o2" through "#o5". Afterwards use ".fadeIn()" and ".fadeOut()" to add functionality to the "STRIP ME" button.</p>
						<p>The <b>second</b> solution is a bit trickier to understand but shortens your code significantly. The idea in this solution is to notice that "s1" and "o1" are correlated, "s2" and "o2" are correlated and so on. So what if there was a way to get the number of the outfit selected and display the corresponding outfit on Drake? Lucky for you, there is a way to do this. (Hint: remember the keyword "this" and look up the documentation for the "slice()" function in JQuery. Use these in order to obtain the number from "outfit-selection".) Once you have the number from the selected outfit, concatenate the string "o" and your number to get the correlated outfit to display.</p>
						<p>Afterwards use ".fadeIn()" and ".fadeOut()" to add functionality to the "STRIP ME" button.</p> -->
				<p>We're also going to add functionality to the "STRIP ME" button. Let's first get the
					<code>#strip-button</code> element. When you click on the <code>#strip-button</code> element, hide
					all the outfits (Hint: can we call the same function that we made earlier?) Then, show the body.</p>
