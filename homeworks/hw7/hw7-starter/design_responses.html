							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> There are many ways to connect design to the human experience to make it more accesible, understandable, and enjoyable to read. I thought the idea of connecting psychology to deisgn was pretty in cool. It's almost as though the deisng itself can seem effortless but still communicate to the reader or user the design's original intent.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The re-introduction of different Gestalt Principles was really interesting. Specifically, the portion about closer in the later part of the article. This has always been a pretty cool topic to me considering how the brain is so easily able to connect dots when looking at the bigger picture of things.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Closure can help us minimise visual noise and convey a message, reinforcing a concept within a pretty small space. There are different ways of making elements perceived as being similar, and thus, related. These include similarity of colour, size, shape, texture, dimension, and orientation; with some of them being more strongly communicative than others (ex. colour > size > shape).</p>
