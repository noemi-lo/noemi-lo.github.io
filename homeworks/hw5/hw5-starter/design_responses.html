                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>I learned there are various ways to communicate a website's conent to an audience. Designers can use smooth transitions that ease their users into new pages and new content. This way, they don't overwhelm their audience with too much at once.</p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>This was a unique article in that it was all animations of websites and/or mobile apps in action. I really enjoyed this aspect because I could see various ways designers could implement spacing and color theory. By seeing this, I can now have inspiration for possible future projects.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p>My favorite inspiration was probably the transportation made by Lubo≈° Volkov. It seems like an Uber or Lyft type mobile application that saves the lower parts of the mobile screen for all the tools the user needs to use for easy acces. The designer also utilized dark mode to make the experience easier on the eyes and, at least for me, give it a futuristic look (the color palette helps with this). Additionally, I like the use of circular buttons and transitions since they give the app a more friendly interface.</p>
