        <p>Welcome to the Inspect Element and JavaScript console lab!</p>
        <p>Inspect element is super helpful for debugging in web development, so we'll be focusing on solidifying our
          inspect element skills in this lab!</p>

      <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
      <p>
      <p>Today, we'll spend some time working with the Chrome developer tools. We've designed this lab with your final
        projects in mind, as we're sure that the features we use today will come in handy over the next few weeks. </p>
      <p>Inside the "lab7-starter" folder, please create an index.html file and include all your answers (both text and
        images) on that single file. As usual, you'll submit your files through Github. No need to worry about styling,
        but please number your answers.</p>

          <p>Submit your files to your GitHub Submission Repository by copying all the files inside the
            "lab7-starter" folder into the lab7 folder of your submission
            repository (replace the index.html originally in it). In your terminal, from your GitHub
            Submission Repository, run the following Git commands:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>git add -A</li>
            <li>git commit -m 'finished lab7'</li>
            <li>git push</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This assignment is due Monday, April 14th at 7:00PM PDT.</p>
